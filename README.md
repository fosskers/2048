2048
====

[Play it here!](http://fosskers.github.io/2048/)

This is an implementation of the recently popular game
[2048](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)) in the
[Elm Language](http://elm-lang.org/). Elm is a great language for making
interactive websites. Check it out!

### How to Play
Use the arrow keys to shift rows of Blocks around on a board.
If two Blocks of equal number come into contact, they add together. The goal
is to reach 2048, but it is possible to get higher than that. Do you have
the skill (and the patience) to reach 2048?
